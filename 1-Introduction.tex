\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are large-scale propagating
disturbances observed in the solar corona. These waves were discovered
through observations made by SOHO/EIT \citep{1997SoPh..175..571M,
  1998GeoRL..25.2465T, 1999ApJ...517L.151T}, and were hence initally
dubbed `EIT' waves. Since those first observations, over two hundred
papers discussing their properties, causes and physics have been
published. EUV waves appear to be strongly associated with CME
activity \cite{2002ApJ...569.1009B}, and to a lesser extent with solar
flares \citep{2006ApJ...641L.153}. However, at a fundamental level, the
physical nature of EUV waves is not completely understood.

In interpreting these phenomena, a variety of explanations have been put forward \citep[see][for a
review of current interpretations of EUV waves]{2011SSRv..158..365G}. Some studies present evidence
supporting a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave interpretation
\citep{1998GeoRL..25.2465T, 1999ApJ...517L.151T,2000ApJ...543L..89W,
  2001JGR...10625089W, 2002ApJ...574..440O, 2010ApJ...713.1008S},
while others argue for what \cite{2012SoPh..281..187P} call a “pseudo-wave”
due to either the evolving manifestations of a CME
\citep{1999SoPh..190..107D, 2000ApJ...545..512D, 2008SoPh..247..123D,
  2011ApJ...738..167S} or transient localized brightenings
\citep{2007ApJ...656L.101A, 2007AN....328..760A}.  Some authors have
found evidence indicating that the complex brightenings associated
with EUV waves can be due to a combination of both MHD waves and
pseudo-waves \citep{2002ApJ...572L..99C, 2005ApJ...622.1202C,
  2004A&A...427..705Z, 2009ApJ...705..587C}. A unified explanation of this phenomenon is complicated by the broad range of observed wave propagation speeds \citep{2011A&A...532A.151W} and amplitudes of EUV waves. 

The path of EUV waves have been observed to be modified by nearly all
major coronal features, including active regions
\citep{2000ApJ...543L..89W}, filaments \citep{2012ApJ...753...52L},
coronal holes \citep{2009ApJ...691L.123G}, streamers
\citep{2013ApJ...766...55K} and with varying degrees of transmission,
refraction, reflection and absorption reveal details about the wave
interaction with these features. However, the impulsive excitation,
and the range of interactions between the EUV waves and other coronal
structures are still unknown. EUV waves are also clearly correlated with several other dynamic phenomena in addition to CMEs
and flares. For example, investigations such as
\cite{2000SoPh..193..161T}, \cite{2004A&A...427..705Z} and
\cite{2010ApJ...709..369P} have indicated that the development of
coronal dimmings may be closely linked to the development of EUV
waves.

Some authors have also explored the potential of EUV waves in
diagnosing properties of the coronal medium that are otherwise hard to
measure, i.e., their use as tools to perform coronal seismology
\citep{1970PASJ...22..341U}. For example, if a fast MHD wave mode
interpretation is assumed, then the wave
propagation speed, coronal density and temperature can all be
estimated from observations, allowing the coronal magnetic field
strength to be derived \citep{2005LRSP....2....3N}.  This value can
also be used to test the accuracy of magnetic field extrapolation
codes \citep{2008ApJ...675.1637S} and other indirect measurements of
the coronal magnetic field strength \citep{2007Sci...317.1192T}.


Recent advances in solar instrumentation have allowed substantial
progress to be made over early SOHO/EIT observations. Data from
STEREO/EUVI provided a significant improvement in both spatial and
temporal resolution (e.g., \cite{2008ApJ...680L..81L,
  2008ApJ...681L.113V}.  Critically, with the launch of SDO in 2010,
highly detailed, multi-wavelength observations of EUV waves are now
possible (e.g. Fig. 2), illuminating the complex structure and
interactions of these waves (e.g., \cite{2012ApJ...753...52L}). With
these new data, studies of individual wave events (e.g.,
\cite{2011ApJ...741L..21L}) have augmented earlier kinematic studies
\citep{1999SoPh..190..467W, 2000ApJ...543L..89W}, improving the
description of the initiation and subsequent deceleration of EUV
waves.

However, a key limitation is that, in order to answer all of the
fundamental questions regarding the physical nature of EUV waves,
studying individual wave events or small samples is insufficient. To
make the next breakthrough in understanding this phenomenon requires
large-scale statistical studies with events robustly categorized by
their properties. Such studies are too time-intensive in scope to be
carried out manually. Additionally it is challenging to produce statistically reproducable results of large samples with a manual approach. Automated feature detection algorithms have an advantage over human detections of features because they generate repeatable results for
the same input data, i.e. they enable reproducability. In addition,
their ability to examine large quantities of data faster than human
analysis is invaluable in the SDO era, which produces ~1 TB of solar
data each day. The solar physics community already makes use of the
Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus: \cite{2004A&A...425.1097R}) and
Solar Eruptive Event Detection System (SEEDS:
\cite{2008SoPh..248..485O}) CME catalogs, both of which are generated
from automated feature detection algorithms.

Hence, in this paper we present the Automated
Wave Analysis and Reduction in EUV (AWARE) algorithm, a new automated
EUV wave detection and characterization procedure applied to EUV image
data. Such a fully automated procedure is essential in order to unlock
the full potential of the large full-disk image datasets available
from SDO and STEREO, and enables the characterization of EUV waves in
large numbers. AWARE has been developed in the Python programming
language, and makes use of features provided by the SunPy data
analysis package \citep{mumford-proc-scipy-2013}. AWARE is also a
fully open-source, version controlled package, which is freely
available (see Section X).


In Section 2 we discuss existing algorithms for the detection of solar
features, including EUV waves, and their current status. In Section 3
we discuss in detail the AWARE algorithm and pipeline. In Section 4 we
present a number of examples of successful detections with the
algorithm, and demonstrate its diagnostic and characterization
features.
